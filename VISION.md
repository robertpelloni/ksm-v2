# Vision

The ultimate goal of **K-Shoot MANIA v2** is to create the definitive, open-source, cross-platform rhythm game engine that fully replicates and expands upon the original K-Shoot MANIA experience.

## Key Pillars
1.  **Accuracy & Parity**: 1:1 gameplay replication of KSM v1, including judgment logic, laser behavior, and camera tilt.
2.  **Performance**: High-performance C++20 backend capable of running on modest hardware with high frame rates.
3.  **Extensibility**:
    *   Support for `.ksh` (legacy) and `.kson` (modern) chart formats.
    *   Lua scripting for gameplay mods (future).
    *   Skinning support via NocoUI.
4.  **Hardware Support**: Native support for arcade controllers (lights, analog inputs) via `ksmaxis` and custom HID backends.
5.  **Connectivity**: Internet Ranking, Online Song Downloading (Input Gate), and Social Sharing.

## Target Audience
*   Rhythm game enthusiasts who want a stable, accurate simulator.
*   Chart creators (K-Shoot MANIA Editor compatibility).
*   Arcade cabinet owners (Hardware I/O support).
